# Employees Burnout Analysis

## üìä Overview
Employee burnout is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. It can have serious consequences on an individual's well-being and lead to decreased productivity and job performance. In today's fast-paced and constantly connected world, it is increasingly important to recognize and address the signs of burnout to maintain employees' health and well-being.

This project explores the use of regression techniques to predict employee burnout. By analyzing a dataset containing factors such as workload, mental fatigue, job roles, and work-life balance, we aim to develop a model to identify individuals at risk of burnout. By proactively addressing these risks, organizations can prevent burnout and promote employee well-being.


## üìÅ Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 9 columns:

| Column Name              | Description                                                                                 | Example                          |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Employee ID**          | Unique ID allocated for each employee.                                                     | `fife390032003000`              |
| **Date of Joining**      | Date-time when the employee joined the organization.                                        | `2008-12-30`                    |
| **Gender**               | Gender of the employee.                                                                    | `Male/Female`                   |
| **Company Type**         | Type of company where the employee works.                                                  | `Service/Product`               |
| **WFH Setup Available**  | Indicates if work-from-home facility is available.                                          | `Yes/No`                        |
| **Designation**          | Designation level in the organization, ranging from **0.0** to **5.0**.                    | Higher values indicate seniority. |
| **Resource Allocation**  | Number of working hours allocated, ranging from **1.0** to **10.0**.                       | Higher values indicate more resources. |
| **Mental Fatigue Score** | Mental fatigue level experienced by the employee, ranging from **0.0** to **10.0**.         | `0.0` (no fatigue) to `10.0` (extreme fatigue). |
| **Burnout Rate**         | Predicted burnout rate, ranging from **0.0** to **1.0**.                                    | Higher values indicate a higher likelihood of burnout. |
